# Bloom (GlowApplify) - Execution Board MVP

## 🎯 Vision

Transform the personal development industry by creating the first AI-powered Execution Board that converts any goal into a science-backed, executable system in under 5 minutes.

**Not a vision board. An execution system.**

## 🚀 Quick Start for AI Agents

If you're Claude Code or another AI assistant:

1. Start with `01_STRATEGY_MARKET.md` to understand the WHY
2. Read `02_SCIENTIFIC_BASES.md` for the foundational frameworks
3. Review `03_PRODUCT_CONCEPT.md` for the WHAT
4. Study `04_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the HOW
5. Check `05_MVP_ROADMAP.md` for execution priorities
6. Reference `06_UX_DESIGN_SPECS.md` for UI implementation

## 🎯 North Star Metric

**Weekly Active Execution Users (WAEU)**: Users who logged ≥3 completed actions in the last 7 days.

## 🧬 Core Principles

1. **Zero Friction**: User to first action in <10 minutes
2. **AI Does the Thinking**: User only executes
3. **Science-Backed**: Every feature rooted in behavioral psychology
4. **Process Over Results**: Celebrate consistency, not outcomes
5. **Evidence-Based Progress**: Proof layer for accountability

## 📊 Tech Stack (MVP)

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript + Shadcn/UI
- **AI**: Claude API (primary) + GPT-4 (fallback)
- **Backend**: Supabase (DB + Auth + Realtime)
- **Analytics**: PostHog
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 🎨 Brand Essence

**Tagline**: "Stop dreaming. Start executing."

**Positioning**: The Cursor of personal development - AI that understands your complete life context and generates personalized execution systems.

## 📝 Version

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: February 2026  
**Status**: Pre-MVP Development

**Remember**: This isn't about building another productivity app. It's about creating a new category - the Execution Board - that will evolve into the social network of progress.

Build with precision. Execute with speed. 🌱
