plan. Just reacting to what comes.

### 11.7 FAQ - COPY FINAL

**Q1:**
```
❓ Is this another productivity app I'll abandon in 2 weeks?

💡 No. Here's why most people abandon productivity apps:

1. Setup is overwhelming (Notion: 5+ hours)
2. You have to remember to use it
3. It doesn't feel personal

GlowApplify solves all three:
1. Setup: 3 minutes (AI does the work)
2. Reminders: Gentle daily check-ins
3. Personal: Everything is tailored to YOUR life

Plus, 92% of users are still active after 30 days. 
That's 3x the industry average.
```

**Q2:**
```
❓ How is this different from ChatGPT or Claude?

💡 Great question. Here's the difference:

ChatGPT/Claude:
- No memory between conversations
- Just gives advice, builds nothing
- You copy-paste into other tools
- No tracking or accountability

GlowApplify:
- Remembers your entire life context
- Builds an actual execution system for you
- Everything in one place (goals, habits, progress)
- Daily check-ins keep you accountable

Think of it like this:
ChatGPT = Smart friend who gives advice
GlowApplify = Life Copilot that builds + executes your system
```

**Q3:**
```
❓ Do I have to use it every day?

💡 Your system is there whenever you need it.

But here's what we've found:
- Daily users: 3.2x goal completion rate
- Weekly users: 1.8x goal completion rate
- Monthly users: 1.1x (barely better than nothing)

The Evening Check-in takes 90 seconds.
The Morning View takes 2 minutes.

That's 3.5 minutes/day to completely transform your life.

Worth it? We think so. But you decide.
```

**Q4:**
```
❓ What if I'm not "productive" or "ambitious"?

💡 Perfect! This isn't for hustle addicts.

GlowApplify is for anyone who wants to improve 
SOMETHING in their life:

• Get healthier (walk more, sleep better)
• Learn a skill (guitar, Spanish, coding)
• Build better relationships (call mom weekly)
• Read more books
• Feel less stressed
• Find work-life balance

You don't need to be Elon Musk.
You just need to want to be a slightly better 
version of yourself.

That's it. That's the bar.
```

**Q5:**
```
❓ Is my data private?

💡 100% yes.

• We never sell your data. Ever.
• Your conversations are encrypted.
• Your progress is private (unless you choose to share).
• We don't train AI models on your personal info.
• You can delete everything anytime.

We're building a tool to help you, not to exploit you.
```

**Q6:**
```
❓ Can I cancel anytime?

💡 You're not locked into anything.

GlowApplify is free forever.
No credit card required.
No hidden charges.

In the future, we'll add optional premium features.
But the core system? Free. Always.

And if you ever want to leave, your data 
comes with you. We'll export everything.
