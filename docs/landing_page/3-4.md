### SECCIÓN 9: FINAL OBJECTION HANDLING

**Objetivo:** Address concerns antes del signup

```
Q: Is this another productivity app I'll abandon?
A: No. Traditional apps make YOU do the work (setup, 
tracking, adjusting). GlowApplify does the heavy 
lifting. You just follow your personalized plan.

Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?
A: ChatGPT has no memory and builds nothing. 
GlowApplify remembers your entire life context 
and creates an actual execution system with 
tracking, reminders, and progress analytics.

Q: Do I have to use it every day?
A: Your system is there whenever you need it. 
But daily 2-minute check-ins = 10x better results. 
The Evening Check-in takes 90 seconds.

Q: What if I'm not "productive" or "ambitious"?
A: Perfect! This isn't for hustle addicts. It's 
for people who want to improve SOMETHING in their 
life without drowning in complexity.

Q: Is my data private?
A: 100%. We never sell data. Your conversations 
and progress are encrypted and private.

Q: Can I cancel anytime?
A: Yes. It's free forever. No credit card required. 
Future premium features will be optional.

Q: Does this work on mobile?
A: Yes! Web, iOS, and Android. Your life system 
syncs everywhere.
